# markury book
A framework for complex books, in print. Essentially, this is a way to write hypertext physically. Its a framework im developing to solve a design constraint of a ttrpg. The system is complex enough I wanted to develop it on its own, both to seperate the technical and artistic aspects, but also to reuse the framework with other projects.

# framework
markuary is a python program that collects html pages, and converts them into a series of pdfs.

# name origin
Its a play on both markdown and jupyter book. I had tried to use jupyter to format my ttrpg, but it wasnt exactly what i wanted, so i started writing my own solution with markdown.
